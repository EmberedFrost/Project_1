# TRIDENT

# THE ADDITONAL Library We used was Scipy.
This is the group project 1, members including Tyler F, Sergio Cayon, and Terrence T


Trident is a user-friendly software that can be used by institutions, brokers, and individual investors. If you have ever been looking at a specific industry to invest in but you aren’t sure which individual stock to go with (example: You are choosing to invest in chips and you’re stuck in between investing in AMD and NVDA) Trident can give you a strong recommendation based upon your short term and long term investment goals. Our Interface is so simplistic a child could use it.

Concept:
Trident is a financial software for the people. It allows users to interpret professional level analytics  Users will be able to compile past, present and future stock pricing data. Trident will help users  with determining  solid market bias, performing financial research and visualizing financial stock data.


Data Techniques​:
- Yahoo Finance was the API used to fetch the data.
- Financial data was used to perform historical analysis on user's stocks and then perform an optimization analysis. 
- For the Collection, we created different functions to fetch the data from the API and allow the user to input( Stocks, Weights, and years of simulation).


For Exploration:

Fundamental Analysis: Price-to-Earnings(P/E) ratio, Earnings Per Share(EPS).

Statistical Analysis

Historical Performance Analysis

Diversification Analysis: Portfolio diversification.

Portfolio Optimization using Scipy.optimize.

For cleaning: Check_missing_values function.

Challenges:
We compiled and compared data from multiple stocks and compared them to each other. Some issues occurred when using Monte Carlo simulations. Since the data volume was immense.  The code had to be updated to shorten the time it took to load the simulation. 

Other challenges included  pulling in the data for the stocks.

Success!

Success was found early on. When the idea was seamlessly  agreed upon on the concept and when a working demo could be deployed!
